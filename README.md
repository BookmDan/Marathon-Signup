# Run Your Socks Off

I made a marathon sign-up form. 
The inspiration for this project came from [Cherry Blossom Run](https://runsignup.com/Race/WA/Seattle/CherryBlossomRun)

to get it started: 
- **npm install**
- **pipenv install && pipenv shell**
- **export FLASK_APP=app.py**
- **export FLASK_RUN_PORT=5555**
- '**flask db upgrade**' to generate your database.
- '**python seed.py**' to populate it.

- in 'client' -> **npm run dev**
- in 'server' -> **python app.py** to run your development server.
